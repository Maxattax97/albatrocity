# Albatrocity

## What does that even mean?

On a more serious note, I wanted a unique name that described a daemon which observed... Birds have good eyesight... The albatross in particular has especially sharp eyes.

## What it does

Albatrocity is a web utility to monitor your LAN and report status of nodes on the network. It requires minimal configuration and attaches metadata to IP addresses, such as:
- A human friendly label
- Online status
- Tags (mark ownership, system type, groups, etc.)
- Last seen
- Host operating system
- MAC addresses
- Other fingerprint information

It has a filter to quickly sort through these attributes. It's database may persist if desired.

## Installation

To be determined.
